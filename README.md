# g-raph

> An investigation into practical and optimized implementations of graph algorithms.

## Development

This project, as of yet, uses one simple development technology `rust`.

To install rust, first ensure that you have homebrew installed. Follow instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

Once you have homebrew, install `rust`:

```
> brew install rustup
> rustup-init
```

That should do it! Open the project in your text-editor of choice, and mess around! I use VS-Code, and use the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension to help with development
